Assuming all seating capacities are possible, data for passenger count as 0 are considered irrelevant.

Since only 6 type of rate code id are given in data dictionary, the information about a 7th data type(99) is considered invalid.

-- Output: For any taxi the fare amount cannot be a negative amount.VendorID 2 has 558 errors. 
Therefore VendorID 2 has more error in fare_amount data. VendorID 1 has no negative fare amount.


----DQ Check : tip_amount

4 data points given by Vendor 2 have tip amount less than 0.

--DQ Check : tolls_amount

--output

Three data points of tolls amount given by Vendor 2 are invalid (less than zero).
